# The first parameter is -bd, then the build date step is executed. This step slows down a build
# during development. However, prior to a commit that will result in a push, it should always
# be done in order to give the new build a unique build date. The generated date is the value 
# of the "builddate" member of a eb_getinfo call output. Note that the new version of
# ../src/edc/buildversion.h should be commited to github.
